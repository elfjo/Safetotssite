## Definition Maintenance of expected circulating blood volume and body fluid homeostasis of the patient (age dependent). 

## Importance Maintenance of physiological body fluid homeostasis is important for normal organ function. Deviations from this equilibrium (hypo- and hypervolemia) are commonly encountered in the peri-operative period. 

## Consequences

#### Hypovolemia

*   results in hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia
*   hypovolemia is the leading cause of perioperative cardiac arrests (POCA) in children.

#### Hypervolemia

*   dilutional coagulopathy
*   tissue edema

## Prevention and treatment

*   preoperative clinical assessment (capillary refill time, urinary output) and correct preoperative disturbances if required
*   consider using other monitors which may include: Invasive pressure monitoring, SvO<sub>2</sub>, periodical arterial blood gas analysis (acid base state) and non-invasive cardiac output monitors

#### Hypovolemia

*   avoid prolonged fasting times which can lead to hypovolemia
*   correct / minimize pre-operative deficits
*   sufficient IV access
*   maintenance fluids
*   blood and coagulation management

#### Hypervolemia

*   close monitoring and control of fluid administration
*   correction of intraoperative coagulopathy
