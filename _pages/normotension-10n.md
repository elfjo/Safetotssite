This page is part of the [10N-Matrix][1] for a high quality conduct of pediatric anesthesia. ←  [previous (Normovolemia)][2]      |       [next (Normal Heart Rate)][3]  → 
## Definition Maintenance of expected systemic blood pressure within a normal range of the patient (age dependent). So far, the lower limits of acceptable perioperative blood pressure are suggested to be above the 5

<sup>th </sup>percentile range of age dependent normal systolic blood pressure values. In premature neonates the mean arterial blood pressure should correspond to the post-conceptional age. However, there are no international consensus definitions of safe values of systemic blood pressure in children during anesthesia. 
## Importance Deviations from patient specific norms may result in physiologically and clinically relevant impairments of organ and tissue perfusions. 

## Consequences A significant change from pre-operatively measured systemic blood pressure values is frequently observed. Deviations can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and damage. 

## Prevention and treatment

### Strive to achieve sufficient organ perfusion:

*   measure blood pressure correctly and promptly
*   measure blood pressure regularly and increase frequency when indicated
*   consider inaccuracy and limitations of non-invasive blood pressure measurements
*   maintain [normovolemia][2] and [normal heart rate][3]
*   appropriate dosing of drugs
*   compensate for sympathomimetic loss and consider use of vasoactive drugs
*   consider monitoring perfusion by alternative means
*   consider the potential inaccuracy and limitations of the measuring device and method
*   avoid large fluctuations of blood pressure
