## Summary A common potentially life-threatening emergency in children that requires a standardised and effective, locally agreed hospital approach. 

## Background Post-tonsillectomy bleeding occurs in up to 5% of all tonsillectomies with 50% surgical revision. Mortality occurs in up to 1:30 000 patients usually due to delayed intervention. Anaesthetic challenges are hypovolaemia, difficult airway (bleeding and swelling), full stomach (blood) and difficult venous access. 

## Prevention

*   Patients require fluid resuscitation prior to induction of anaesthesia unless the rate of bleeding exceeds the ability to replacement volume
*   Early intravenous/ intra-osseous access is required
*   A hospital care pathway needs to be established with all team members (emergency physicians, anaesthetist, surgeon and nurse) work from the same instructions, precise lines of communication, information required and clinical guidance to achieve the optimal care
*   must have a pre-defined role in this scenario
*   Anticipate a difficult tracheal intubation
*   Prepare adequate airway equipment and drugs
*   2 suction sources available

## Treatment

*   Controlled Rapid Sequence Induction and Intubation with gentle face mask ventilation following induction of anaesthesia and securing the airway with a cuffed tracheal tube.
*   Evaluate intraoperative haemostasis
*   Empty stomach using an oro-gastric (placed by surgeon under direct vision) prior to extubation
*   Ensure haemostasis before extubation of the awake and haemodynamically stable patient
*   Give postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis

## Post Care

*   Consider delayed extubation in case of severe bleeding, unstable patient or unclear coagulation
*   Consider tranexamic acid in severe tonsillar bleeding
*   Consider referral to haematologist if hereditary coagulation order is suspected
