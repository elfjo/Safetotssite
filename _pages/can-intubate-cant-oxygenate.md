## Summary Persistent post-intubation hypoxia can rapidly lead to morbidity and even mortality. Early recognition and effective intervention using a structured approach is required. 

## Background

*   Small children have short and narrow airways requiring small and fragile airway equipment.
*   Obstruction and dislocation of airway devices are common during moving and positioning.
*   Gastric distension significantly reduces functional residual capacity in small children and may considerably impair ventilation and gas exchange.
*   Limited oxygenation and respiratory reserves in small children result in rapid hypoxaemia, carbon dioxide accumulation and respiratory acidosis. High closing capacity in small children increases likelihood of pulmonary atelectasis leading to intra-pulmonary shunt and hypoxaemia.
*   Rapid administration of potent opioids may lead to thoracic rigidity
*   Paediatric patients are at higher risk for bronchial hyper-reactivity particularly those with respiratory infection, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or allergic diathesis.
*   Congenital and acquired diseases may affect lower airway patency or can lead to an acute tracheal tube obstruction

## Prevention

*   Correct positioning of tracheal tube and safe, effective fixation of airway devices is paramount.
*   Suitable and careful positioning and moving of patient with tracheal tube. Ensure stable position when oral procedures (ENT, cleft surgery, gastroenterology, cardiology (Trans Esophageal Echocardiography) are performed.
*   Ensure adequate depth of anaesthesia (+/- muscle relaxation)
*   Appropriate ventilation and recruitment strategies.
*   Consider gastric decompression following airway manoeuvres.
*   Children with copious secretions or pus are at risk of tube obstruction and patency and require regular checking and confirmation.

## Treatment

*   Call for assistance. If in doubt – take it out.
*   The acronym **DOPES** summarizes the most relevant immediately life-threatening causes and interventions that effectively treat the ‘Can Intubate – Can’t Ventilate’ situation.

## Post Care

*   Debriefing is essential (patient, parent, staff)
*   Documentation (patient records, alert card, bracelet) if appropriate
*   Follow–up if and when required
