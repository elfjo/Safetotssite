## Summary Can’t 0xygenate-ventilate situations in children are common and are usually due to functional and/or anatomical airway obstructions. Early recognition and treatment with appropriate skills, equipment and drugs can overcome these situations in otherwise healthy children. 

## Background

*   Most common complication with potential serious morbidity and mortality
*   Most frequent complication in otherwise healthy children.
*   Often associated with lack of skills, knowledge, education, training, experience and the use of age inappropriate equipment
*   Infants and toddlers at particular risk
*   High risk surgeries (ENT)

## Prevention

#### Identify children at risk

*   The child with acute airway infection, bronchial hyperactivity, asthma, allergic predisposition
*   Premature, neonates, infants and toddlers
*   History, signs and symptoms predictive for difficult airway
*   Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS)
*   Acquired and congenital airway abnormalities and diseases

#### Strict transfer policy regarding children at risk

#### Seek experienced consultation and help early

#### Infrastructure and competence Anaesthesia for children should be undertaken or supervised by anaesthetists who have undergone appropriate education, training and experience 

*   Suitable anaesthesia environment
*   Appropriate patient positioning
*   Basic age specific airway equipment
*   Appropriate depth of anaesthesia
*   Immediate access to emergency drugs (prepared)
*   Pre-oxygenation as appropriate and accepted by patient

## Treatment

*   Recognize and treat anatomical/mechanical airway obstruction
*   **Call for help early**
*   Recognize and treat functional airway obstruction
*   Exclude and treat foreign body airway obstruction
*   Endotracheal intubation / laryngeal mask airway
*   [Can’t oxygenate, can’t intubate (COCI) – invasive oxygenation/ ventilation via front of neck airway]

## Post Care

*   Debriefing is essential (patient, parent, staff)
*   Ensure good documentation (patient records, alert card, bracelet)
