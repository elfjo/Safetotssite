## Summary Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) in children can be prevented by slow injection of local anaesthetic agents and careful monitoring for clinical signs. Primary treatment is directed to maintaining oxygenation and circulation before initiating lipid rescue. 

## Background

*   Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) occurs when large quantities of local anaesthetics reach the systemic circulation and depends on multiple variables and presents in various clinical ways ranging from mild neurological symptoms to cardiac toxicity and death
*   Early symptoms and signs of LAST are masked in children if regional anaesthesia is administered during general anaesthesia and sedation
*   Cardiac toxicity of local anaesthetics is potentiated by acidosis and hypoxemia

## Prevention

*   Knowledge of maximum dose and concentration is essential and it is important to individualize the choice of drug, dose and concentration based on the patient’s clinical condition and comorbidities
*   The ‘Stop before you block’ principle allows checking of patient relevant information, dose, contra-indication and type and site of regional anaesthesia before injection local anaesthetics
*   Careful aspiration, passive back-flow, slow injection, test dose with added epinephrine (1:200,000) and close haemodynamic monitoring (blood pressure in 1 minute intervals, pulse oximetry and ECG) allows early detection of inadvertent systemic administration and avoidance of LAST
*   Confirm maximum dose of continuous administration local anaesthetic for neonates and infants as well older children
*   **Ensure availability of:** 
    *   Resuscitative equipment and drugs
    *   Airway equipment: the means to provide bag mask ventilation, oral and nasal airways, laryngoscopes and endotracheal tubes, laryngeal mask airways

## Treatment

*   When suspecting LAST, stop injecting more local anesthetic and call for help
*   Supportive measures to maintain the airway and oxygenation and treating seizures are usually sufficient
*   Maintaining cardiac output using epinephrine and external cardiac massage if necessary results in re-distribution and clearance of the local anaesthetic
*   Secondary administration of Intralipid 20% may hasten recovery from LAST

## Post Care

*   Patients disclosure and careful documentation is required
*   If an allergic reaction is considered arrange further workup and follow-up
