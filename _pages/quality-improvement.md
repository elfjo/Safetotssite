### Why is Quality Improvement (QI) important in paediatric anaesthesia?

**Quality improvement (QI) is a key part of improving outcomes and services.** QI methodology uses cycles of change with continuous monitoring of process outcomes with methods such as [Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA)][1] or [Six Sigma][2]. Key to improving services is measuring outcome with high quality simple data and a local culture open to change and focusing on care quality.

### ‘State of the art’

**‘State of the art’ in pediatric anesthesia is frequently defined and propagated** at scientific meetings, congresses and in the literature in the form of expert lectures, opinions and reviews. **However, economic pressures, lack of trained staff and pediatric resources** lead to situations where low-risk anesthesia rapidly turns into high-risk anesthesia. In addition, transition of ‘state of the art’ into clinical practice is hampered by a lack of financial incentive (grants), recognition (impact factors), and lack of personal gain (professional advancement). Evaluation of the impact of good clinical practice as well as dedicated teaching and supervision of residents is currently not perceived to be academically rewarding. 
### Standards of peri-operative care differ across sites

**The practice of pediatric anesthesia and occurrence of critical perioperative events varies worldwide.** It is of note that in some European countries (Denmark, Netherlands, UK and Switzerland) two adequately qualified persons are required for induction and emergence of general anesthesia in children. This is in stark contrast to daily clinical practice in many other countries. **Anesthesia residents and fellows are frequently not supervised** on a one-to-one basis or do not receive structured pediatric training and education. This results in ‘survival’ medicine rather than quality-focused peri-operative pediatric anesthesia care. **Exemplary programs are, however, available** (The Scandinavian Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, UK Royal College of Anaesthetists) and the effects of such programs have recently been made available. 
### Regular pediatric anesthesia practice improves outcomes

**Regular practice improves outcomes.** A very small annual case load of general anesthetics in small children/per anesthesiologist may lead to severe complications. Anesthesia care provision by experienced clinicians for higher risk patients in dedicated centers may lead to a reduction to severe critical perioperative events. Anesthesia departments who offer specialized, extensive or complex surgical and diagnostic procedures should be proficient in routine pediatric anesthesia care and provide regular training and professional development. **Clear strategies and recommendations for areas of Quality Improvement include:** 
*   Standardization of serious critical event definitions and reporting
*   Implementation of current best practice in provision of competent paediatric anaesthesia ([see 10Ns][5])
*   Development of evidence-based protocols for management and training of serious critical events ([see 10Cs][6])
*   Implementation of systems for ensuring maintenance of skills The Institutional Competences are addressed in 

[‘Who’, ’Where’, ‘When’, ‘What’ and ‘How’][7] need to be identified to achieve an optimal outcome for vulnerable children.
