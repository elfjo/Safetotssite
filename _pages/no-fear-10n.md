## Definition Fear: Unpleasant emotion caused by an actual or perceived threat, danger, pain, loss or harm. 

## Importance Preoperative anxiety in children may result from the fear of pain, unfamiliar surroundings, a sense of loss of control, the presence of strangers, parental anxiety and many other perceived threats to their world. Some children will openly say they are frightened, others will cry, withdraw, cling to their parents or become agitated. 

## Consequences

*   anxiety may reduce cooperation; contribute to emergence delirium and increase pain and behavioral disturbances (sleep disturbances or nightmares, enuresis, separation anxiety and increased fear of doctors) after surgery.
*   up to 50% of children will still have these disturbances two weeks after surgery and some several months.
*   the incidence is increased after a stormy anaesthetic induction and can be reduced if premedication or other strategies are used to reduce preoperative anxiety.

## Prevention and treatment There are 3 strategies that can be used to reduce or moderate anxiety: 

*   age-appropriate psychological preparation/ education (e.g. verbal or written information, video, iPad, hospital tours, and role playing)
*   parental presence (can be stressful to some parents)
*   pharmacological premedication (benzodiazepines, α2-agonists, ketamine).

## Special situations and challenges

*   the apprehensive child
*   the combative child
*   refusal
*   parental anxiety and expectations
