This page is part of the [10N-Matrix][1] for a high quality conduct of pediatric anesthesia. ←  [previous (No Fear)][2]      |       [next (Normovolemia)][3]  → 
## Definition Postoperative recall of sensory perception during general anaesthesia (no consensus definition available). 

## Importance

*   intraoperative awareness is more common in children (0.5-1.0%) compared to adults (0.1-0.2%)
*   it may occur in non-paralyzed children without signs of inadequate anaesthesia
*   does not seem to be associated with distress or post-traumatic stress disorders
*   the reasons for the high incidence in children are not known.

## Consequences

*   unknown, may have major implications on social life

## Risk factors include

*   drugs (neuromuscular blockade, thiopenthone, TIVA)
*   patients (female gender, age (younger adults), obesity, previous awareness, possibly difficult airway management)
*   subspecialties (obstetric, trauma, cardio-thoracic, neurosurgical)
*   organizational (out-of-hours surgery, junior anaesthetist).

## Prevention

*   identify risk factors
*   proper information preoperatively
*   consider the use of neuro-monitoring in patients with risk factors – particularly if previous awareness

## Treatment

*   administer benzodiazepines if awareness is suspected
*   if serious psychological problems occur (flash-backs, nightmares, new anxiety states and depression) the child should be referred to psychological service.
