## Summary Skills and in-depth knowledge are essential. It is important to recognize airway abnormalities before any airway manipulation. Call for help early if doubts about the ability to ventilate exist. Limit the tracheal intubation attempts and always consider a supraglottic airway as an alternative. 

## Background

*   The vast majority of children are usually easy to intubate
*   Patients do not come to harm because they cannot be intubated but are harmed because of repeatedly trying to intubate
*   Often associated with lack of skills, knowledge, education, training, experience and use of age inappropriate equipment
*   Infants and toddlers are at particular risk

## Prevention

#### Identify children at risk

*   Children aged <1 year (unfamiliar anatomy and limited experience)
*   Previous difficult intubation
*   Craniofacial deformities and facial dysmorphia
*   Airway abnormalities associated with genetic syndromes and diseases
*   Acquired abnormalities (burns, contractures, hardware)

#### Strict transfer policy regarding children at risk

#### Seek experienced consultation and help early

## Infrastructure and competence Anaesthesia for children should be undertaken or supervised by anaesthetists who have undergone appropriate education, training and experience 

*   Suitable anaesthesia environment
*   Appropriate patient positioning
*   Basic age specific airway equipment
*   Adequate depth of anaesthesia and muscle relaxation
*   Use of appropriate technique including external laryngeal manipulation
*   Pre-oxygenation as appropriate and accepted by patient

## Treatment

*   Limit of initial tracheal intubation attempts to maximum 2 attempts
*   Maintain oxygenation, ventilation and anaesthesia at all times.
*   Consider indication for intubation and possibility to use supraglottic airway or face mask only
*   Alternative airway technique or operator according to local expertise
*   Insert supraglottic airway for emergency situations or for awakening of patient postponing procedure

## Post Care

*   Debriefing (patient, parent, staff)
*   Documentation (patient records, alert card, bracelet)
