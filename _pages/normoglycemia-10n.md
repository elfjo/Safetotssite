## Definition Normal blood glucose concentration within the age specific normal range. 

## Importance Blood glucose homeostasis is important for ensuring a continuing energy supply and stable plasma osmolality. Small infants have reduced glycogen storage capacity and hence have a limited ability to maintain blood glucose concentrations during periods of fasting. 

## Consequences Acute and chronic changes in blood glucose concentrations have significant consequences to the perioperative outcome. 

#### Hypoglycemia

*   irritability
*   seizures
*   hemodynamic instability
*   coma, death

#### Hyperglycemia

*   hyperosmolality
*   ketoacidosis
*   polyuria and dehydration and
*   seizures, death

## Prevention and treatment

*   awareness of fasting and nutrition status of the patient, minimize preoperative fasting times
*   perioperative (surgical) stress reduction (analgesia and body temperature control)
*   situation appropriate monitoring (neonates, critically ill children) and investigations
*   consider isotonic glucose containing perioperative intravenous solutions especially in preterm, neonates and small infants, patient on total parental nutrition (TPN) and critically ill patients
*   patients with inherited and acquired endocrine or glucose dependent metabolic disorders require special attention and workup
*   prompt and appropriate treatment of significant hypo- and hyperglycemia
