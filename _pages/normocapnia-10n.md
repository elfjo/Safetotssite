## Definition Maintenance of expected arterial carbon dioxide tension. 

## Importance Blood arterial carbon dioxide tensions are modified during anesthesia. Changes in arterial carbon dioxide tensions significantly affect body homeostasis including the acid-base status, the sympathomimetic tone and organ blood flow. 

## Consequences Acute and chronic changes in arterial carbon dioxide tensions lead to short and long term outcomes: 

*   modulation of vasoreactivity
*   central nervous system damage
*   beuro-behavioural changes

## Prevention and treatment

*   aim to achieve adequate carbon dioxide tensions
*   acute changes in carbon dioxide tensions are commonly a result of difficulties and critical incidences during airway and ventilation management.

#### Prevention requires:

*   regular teaching and training of ventilation strategies
*   consider limitations of monitoring and airway equipment
*   use cuffed endotracheal tubes if appropriate
*   recognise discrepancies between arterial and end-tidal carbon dioxide tensions   

*   Establish regulation for delivery of adequate ventilation management
*   Avoid acute high amplitude fluctuations of arterial carbon dioxide tension
