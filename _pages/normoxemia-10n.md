This page is part of the [10N-Matrix][1] for a high quality conduct of pediatric anesthesia. ←  [previous (Normal Heart Rate)][2]      |       [next (Normocapnia)][3]  → 
## Definition Normal oxygen tension in the blood. Adequate oxygen supply permits aerobic metabolism. 

## Importance

*Hypoxemia* is commonly encountered during pediatric anesthesia. Prolonged hypoxemia may lead to adverse short and long-term outcomes. *Hyperoxemia* is iatrogenic and may result in the production of reactive oxygen species affecting normal organ function. 
## Consequences Acute and chronic changes in oxygen tensions result in physiologically and clinically relevant tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. 

#### Hypoxemia Hypoxemia may results in severe tissue hypoxia, bradyardia, cerebral and other organ hypoperfusion. 

#### Hyperoxemia Prolonged hyperoxemia may affect organ development and function such as retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 

## Prevention

*   aim to achieve adequate oxygen tensions
*   acute hypoxia is commonly a result of difficulties and critical incidences during airway and ventilation management

#### Prevention requires:

*   regular teaching and training
*   equipment and drugs
*   suitable staffing
*   assessment und preparation of patient
*   local algorithms for the (un)expected / risky airway difficulties should be established.
*   establish regulation for delivery of adequate FiO<sub>2</sub>and ventilation management
