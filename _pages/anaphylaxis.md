## Summary

*   Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening, generalised or systemic hypersensitivity reaction
*   Anaphylaxis is very rare in children but requires swift and effective recognition and treatment

## Background

*   Severe anaphylactic reactions in children are rare
*   Main triggers are antibiotics, colloids, hypnotics, muscle relaxants, intravenous contrast and latex
*   Prompt recognition and early treatment is required to avoid morbidity and mortality

## Prevention

*   Take careful patient history
*   High index of suspicion if severe hypotension and/or bronchospasm occurs
*   Knowledge of potential cross-reactivity
*   Eliminate potential triggers (latex free environment)
*   Ensure availability of effective drug treatments
*   **Alternative Diagnosis:** Intestinal eventration syndrome, local anaesthetic systemic toxicity

## Treatment

*   Call for help
*   Stop the triggering agent
*   Give Epinephrine 10 micrograms/kg IM, repeat iv as required
*   Give Epinephrine IV (1-2-3-5-10 micrograms/kg) titrated according to effect
*   Maintain/ establish airway, give high flow oxygen, monitor vital signs
*   Consider raising legs/ fluid challenge if hypotension
*   Give antihistamines and steroids

## Post Care

*   Take three timed blood samples for serum tryptase (as soon as possible, 1-2 hours and >24h after event).
*   Develop urgent management plan according to clinical needs.
*   Monitor patient carefully in the postoperative period.
*   Provide patient letter and letter to family physician
*   Arrange referral to allergy clinic
