This page is part of the [10N-Matrix][1] for a high quality conduct of pediatric anesthesia. ←  [previous (No Postoperative Discomfort)][2]      |       [next (No PONV)][3]  → It refers to the concept [No Postoperative Discomfort][2] 
## **Definition** Unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such. 

## **Importance** A large number of children still experience significant pain in the perioperative period. Poor pain control remains a significant problem following hospital discharge. 

## **Consequences** Inadequate perioperative pain control can lead to a variety of behavioural and somatic changes. 

## **These include:**

*   altered behaviour (emotional)
*   subsequent altered pain perception
*   prolonged hospital stays and increased re-admission rates
*   chronic pain
*   negative parental perception
*   social consequences

## **Good Practice Points**

*   regularly assess pain in all children to “make pain visible”
*   chart pain as a vital sign
*   ensure clear appropriate protocols to bring pain scores down and to maintain low pain scores
*   reassess pain after analgesic interventions to ensure efficacy and to minimize side effects (titration)
*   use multimodal analgesia and opioid-sparing techniques where possible and as appropriate
*   ensure continuing analgesia at home

## **Follow-Up/ Outcome**

*   audit pain assessments, high pain scores and pain at home and plan QI initiatives
*   audit adverse effects, critical incidents and drug errors and make plans to reduce incidence

## **Key references**
