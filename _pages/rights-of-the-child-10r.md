**Children’s rights are human rights.** In 1989 the United Nations declared the Convention of the Rights of Children<sup>1</sup>, promoting  the rights and the protection of children to develop their full potential, free from hunger and want, neglect and abuse.

**Article 24 of the UN's Convention of the Rights of Children** addresses the rights and the special demands of children in health care institutions recognizing that children are especially vulnerable. 

**The EACH Charter (1988)**<sup>3</sup> recognises and endorses the rights of the child as stipulated in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), and in particular the key principle that, in all situations, the best interests of the child should prevail (art.3).

As commitment to the Convention of the Rights of Children and The EACH Charter the Safetots.org initiative adjusted this to the perioperative situation and issued the following 10 Rights (10 R).
