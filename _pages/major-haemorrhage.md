## Summary Major perioperative haemorrhage is the leading cause of severe morbidity and mortality in children and its successful management requires close co-operation with the surgical team. 

## Background Unexpected major surgical haemorrhage is the leading cause for perioperative cardiac arrests in children. Morbidity and mortality during major haemorrhage is related to insufficient venous access, inadequate monitoring, underestimation of blood loss, lack of control of clotting and access to blood products. 

## Prevention

*   Know your patient
*   Know your surgeon and intended procedure
*   Smart choice of number and type of vascular access and monitoring
*   Maintain normovolaemia, look for signs of hypovolaemia (capillary refill time, arterial pulse wave)
*   Consider clotting and haemostasis
*   Be prepared for the unexpected sudden blood loss (fluids, blood, equipment for intraosseous access, epinephrine)

## Treatment

*   Early call for help and additional resources
*   Determine cause, collaborate with surgeon (tamponade/ embolization/ cross clamping)
*   Consider additional venous or intra-osseous access as required
*   Give fluids/volume
*   Catecholamines
*   Consider tranexamic acid
*   Monitor haemostasis repeatedly (laboratory, ROTEM)
*   Order and give blood products and clotting factors as indicated
*   Consult with haematologist and intensivist
*   Consider and exclude other reasons for haemodynamic instability (cardiologist)

## Post Care

*   Re-establish normovolaemia and haemostasis
*   Delayed extubation (PICU)
*   Careful documentation
*   Follow-up
*   Patient disclosure and debriefing
