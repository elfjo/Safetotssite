## **Definition** Body temperature within the normal physiological range 

## **Importance an Consequences**

**Hypothermia** is a common problem in children exposed to anaesthetic drugs – especially in the youngest age groups. Hypothermia during anaesthesia has many harmful consequences and may trigger multiple physiological changes (increased metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, prolonged bleeding time and increased risk for postoperative infection) and influence the pharmacokinetic and –dynamics of anaesthetics. **Hyperthermia** most commonly occurs because of iatrogenic overheating and failure to decrease the temperature of the exogenous heat source in the face of an increasingly body temperature. Other causes of hyperthermia include [malignant hyperthermia][4], thyrotoxicosis and sepsis. 
## **Prevention and Treatment** Temperature can be monitored in the axilla, bladder, nasopharynx, esophagus, rectum, tympanic membrane and the skin. Core temperature is most accurately measured on the tympanic membrane or the esophagus. Core temperature monitoring should be monitored in procedures lasting more than 30 min with an effort to maintain temperature > 36°C. External forced-air warming should be used to prevent hypothermia. Ambient temperature should be maintained between 21°and 26°C with a relative humidity level of 40-60%. IV solutions should be considered warmed to 38°C in high risk cases.
